Cultivation Analysis in India (1997-2020)
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Rice Cultivation Trends Across Indian States

Project Overview

This project analyzes rice cultivation trends in India from 1997 to 2020 using data visualization and statistical techniques. The goal is to understand seasonal variations, state-wise production trends, and the relationship between area, production, and yield.

Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the Ministry of Agriculture, India and contains information on crop production, area cultivated, and seasonal patterns across various states.

Key Insights

1) Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and UP have the highest cultivation area, while Puducherry has the highest rice yield in 2019-20.
2) Rabi season shows the highest average rice yield, likely due to controlled irrigation.
3) Despite increasing cultivated area, yield remains stable, indicating the role of irrigation, soil quality, and farming techniques.
4) Correlation between production & yield is 0.44, meaning yield increases with production but is not directly dependent on area expansion.

Data Visualization

This project includes:
1) Bar charts â†’ State-wise cultivation area
2) Pie charts â†’ Distribution of cultivation across states
3) Choropleth maps â†’ Number of crops grown per state
4) Line plots â†’ Trend analysis of area, production, and yield
5) Box plots & strip plots â†’ Seasonal yield variations
6) Heatmaps â†’ Correlation between area, production, and yield
7) Regression plots â†’ Seasonal yield comparisons

Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
Jupyter Notebook for EDA
